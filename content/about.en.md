## What is Arbitrium?

**Arbitrium** (Latin: *judgment, decision, the ability to discern*) — a comprehensive philosophical system unifying ontology, metaphysics, and applied doctrines into a single structure.

## The Problem

Modern civilization lacks a universally accepted worldview foundation. Existing systems — religious, secular, scientific — are fragmented or mutually incompatible. This creates a crisis of foundations: there is no criterion for distinguishing truth from error.

## The Solution

Arbitrium offers a system built deductively from a single foundation — the concept of absolute immutability.

**Core:** Ontology of Nothing — a philosophical formalization deriving the structure of being from an immutable foundation.

**Method:** Distinctio — a procedure for ontological arbitration of interpretations. Verdict: valid / apparent / untenable.

## Structure

From the core, the basic chain is deductively derived:

**Epistemology → Anthropology → Ethics**

From the basic chain — applied doctrines covering all spheres: politics, economics, law, education, science, and others.

## Author

**Serik Bolatjanovich Rysjanov** — independent researcher, author of the monographs "Ontology of Nothing" and "The Proto-Semitic Root *ʔil-".
