## What is Arbitrium?

**Arbitrium** (Latin: *judgment, decision, the ability to discern*) is a comprehensive philosophical system that unifies ontology, metaphysics, and applied doctrines into a single structure.

## The Core

At the foundation of Arbitrium lies the mutual verification of two sources of knowledge:

- **Ontology of Nothing** — a philosophical system deriving the structure of being from the concept of absolute immutability
- **Transcendent information** — a source verified for consistency with the ontology

The key concept is absolute immutability as the foundation of all change.

## Structure

From the core, the **basic chain** is deductively derived:

**Epistemology → Anthropology → Ethics**

From the basic chain — **17 applied doctrines** covering all spheres of existence: politics, economics, law, education, science, technology, medicine, art, cosmology, eschatology, and others.

## The Instrument

**Distinctio** — a procedure for ontological arbitration of interpretations. Applied at all levels of the system.

Verdict: *valid / apparent / untenable*.

## Author

**Serik Bolatjanovich Rysjanov** — independent researcher, author of the monographs "Ontology of Nothing" and "The Proto-Semitic Root *ʔil-".

## NAR-UQ Foundation
