## Ontology of Nothing

The monograph "Ontology of Nothing" is the philosophical foundation of the Arbitrium system. It solves the classical aporia: how does changeable reality arise from an absolutely immutable foundation.

## The Problem

Any change presupposes a foundation that itself does not change. But how can the immutable be a source of change? This is the central question of metaphysics, to which neither ancient philosophy, nor medieval theology, nor modern European thought have given a satisfactory answer.

## The Solution

Absolute immutability is identical to Nothing — the absence of any determinations. Nothing is not emptiness or non-being. It is pure indeterminacy that determines itself through the act of differentiation.

Differentiation generates information. Information is the primary ontological category, preceding matter and consciousness.

## Structure of the Monograph

The monograph consists of 28 chapters organized in 4 parts:

1. Statement of the problem and critique of existing solutions
2. Derivation of categorical structure from Nothing
3. Ontology of consciousness and information
4. Teleological closure of the system
