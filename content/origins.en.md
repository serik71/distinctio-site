## About this section

This section is dedicated to the study of religious traditions in order to identify their common foundations. Not traditional religious studies, but analysis from the perspective of the Arbitrium system.

The goal is neither apology nor criticism of individual religions, but the search for a unified foundation upon which they are built.

## Approach

Each religious tradition is considered as a source subject to analysis. The author's position (presented at nar-uq.com) is considered as one approach among others.

This demonstrates the objectivity of the system: Arbitrium is applied to all interpretations, including those of its author.
