## Basic Chain

From ontology, the basic chain is deductively derived:

**Epistemology → Anthropology → Ethics**

## Epistemology

The study of knowledge. If being is structured as a system of differentiations, then cognition is the recognition of differentiations.

**Status:** in development

## Anthropology

The study of human nature. If cognition is structured as recognition of differentiations, then the knowing subject is a system capable of differentiation.

**Status:** in development

## Ethics

The study of action. If the human being is a system of differentiations, then right action is action aligned with the ontological structure.

**Status:** in development
